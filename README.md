# WeatherChannel
In this application, the user is able to search up the weather 
of any city that they can think of (as long as it's on Earth and a part of the OpenWeath API).
I have made an input box for the user to type in a city name, the button next to it has a magnifying glass signifying a search.
There is a separte section for current weather and another for the 5-day forecast.
